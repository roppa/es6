#ES6

Demonstrating some ECMA Script 6 (es6) features.

##Variables - Let and Const

'let' has a block level scope, rather than function scope. It is ideal in for loops or "flag" variables.

'const' as the name suggests is a constant value. Any attempt to reassign the value results in an syntax error. Any redeclaration throws an error.

'const' and 'let' affords more information to the software engineer, rather than seeing 'var' everywhere.

##Arrow functions

Example with one parameter. If a function needs to provide an iterator when the user does not pass one in, this will be handy

```
let identity = identity => identity;
```
